# Peip 2 - Algorithmic and data structure

## Description

> The goal of this course is to give you bases in algorithmic so that, on simple cases, you are capable of :
> - **justifying the validity of an algorithm**, and to know how to test its implementation,
> - **evaluating the complexity of the algorithm**, in order to implement an efficient program,
> - **knowing the classical data structures** in order to choose the one which is adapted to the problem to be solved.
> 
> The support language is java, you will have to ensure the good object design of your programs.
